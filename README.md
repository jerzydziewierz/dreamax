# Dreamax

This is a scalable implementation of the model-based RL algorithm [Dreamer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01603) (Hafner et al., 2019) in [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax).

We used Yarden As' [yardenas/jax-dreamer](https://github.com/yardenas/jax-dreamer) implementation as the starting point for our implementation.

For bug reports please use github issues.
